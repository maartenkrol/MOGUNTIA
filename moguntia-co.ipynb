    "Tropospheric CO strongly influences the oxidation efficiency of our atmosphere. Gloablly aveargaed, more than half the hydroxyl radicals (OH) react with CO. This reaction is also the dominant sink for CO as surface deposition and other reaction pathways are relatively minor. Biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion are main anthropogenic CO sources that account for about 40% of the global source. Contributions from the different source categories are given in Table 1.\n",

    "Increasing CO as a consequence of anthropogenic emissions in the past century has likely contributed to a global depletion of OH and thus a reduction of the oxidation efficiency of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the recent trend reversal of CO, possibly due to a moderation of anthropogenic emissions, may have contributed to a partial recovery of OH levels. Global observations and the quantification of CO changes and its budget are of utmost importance to monitor the state of our atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the global CO burden of the atmosphere is fairly well known, the estimates of source categories are highly uncertain. Most of the emission estimates have uncertainty ranges of about 50%. For example, the CO yield from non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) oxidation in the atmosphere is poorly known. Large quantities of natural NMHC are emitted as isoprene and monoterpenes. Both the emissions of these gases and their reaction products are poorly quantified. If removal of soluble or aerosol forming NMHC reaction intermediates would be important, this would substantially limit the amount of CO released from these compounds. Models can help quantifying these processes by integration of the growing knowledge about sources, transport and chemical mechanisms, and through comparisons with observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifetime of CO varies considerably in the atmosphere. In the high latitude winter this lifetime is relatively long (>0.5 year) because the OH radical concentrations are very low. At low altitudes in the tropics, where both radiation and water vapor abundance promote OH radical formation, the CO lifetime drops to values less than a month. At mid-latitudes the seasonal cycle is characterized by CO buildup in winter and depletion in summer. On the one hand, CO lives long enough to be transported over considerable distances. On the other hand, its lifetime is short enough that it can be present in the background atmosphere in rather small concentrations."
