    "The oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere is for a large part determined by the OH radical. This radical is produced as a result of ozone photolysis in the presence of water vapor:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "{\\rm O_3 + h\\nu \\longrightarrow O(^1D) + O_2} \\\\\n",
    "{\\rm O(^1D) + H_2O \\longrightarrow 2 OH}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "On a global scale the most important sink for OH is its reaction with either CO or methane, relatively well-mixed gases that limit the lifetime of OH to 1-10 seconds. In the planetary boundary layer, however, non-methane hydrocarbons may be the dominant OH sink, in particular in polluted and forested areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifetime of many trace gases, and most notably those of methane and CO, is determined by the reaction with OH. In order to understand the tropospheric trends and mixing ratios of these gases, knowledge of the tropospheric OH distribution and its temporal variation is therefore of vital importance. Figure 1 illustrates the central position of the OH radical in tropospheric chemistry.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods to measure OH in-situ in the troposphere are rapidly being developed and these measurements show that the OH concentration is highly variable in space and time. This is expected on a theoretical basis, since the OH production is mainly determined by ozone, water vapor, and UV-B radiation, which are extremely variable in the troposphere. For instance, the variability of UV-B is caused by the variable solar zenith angle, clouds, surface reflections, and the overhead ozone column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since reaction with OH is the most important sink for methane, measurements of methane may be used to estimate the globally averaged OH concentration. This requires detailed knowledge of the methane sources. However, since methane is emitted by many anthropogenic and natural sources, estimates of the total source are rather uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methylchloroform (1,1,1 trichloroethane, CH$_3$CCl$_3$, hereafter called MCF) provides a better opportunity to constrain tropospheric OH concentrations. Sources of this compound are purely anthropogenic and it is claimed that the emissions are known with high accuracy. Most sources are located in the northern hemisphere, which results in a latitudinal gradient from north to south. Since the beginning of the 1990s the MCF mixing ratios in the troposphere are declining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In global three-dimensional tropospheric chemistry modeling it has become a common exercise to test the calculated OH fields by simulating the MCF mixing ratio at the so-called ALE/GAGE stations. Due to the uncertainties in the OH chemistry, rate constants, photolysis frequencies and the distribution of OH precursors and sinks, the accuracy of the calculated OH fields is limited. Therefore, some deviation between the measurements and the model results can be expected. It is estimated that a typical value of global mean OH is uncertain up-to about 25% due to kinetics imprecision. Figure 2 displays typical OH fields that are used in MOGUNTIA. Clearly, more OH is present on the summer hemisphere.\n",

In this period, we are observing a decaying burden of MCF, due to strongly reduced emissions. These emission reductions are caused by the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments.
